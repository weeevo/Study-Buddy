There is a light and dark mode available, and button colors are fully customizable through the options page!    

## How to use
### Timer 
In the Timer tab, Type the hour and minute values for each timer, leaving a box blank for 0.  
Press **start** to begin timer and start working, and to pause (for a bathroom break or another reason) just press **stop**.  
Press **skip** to start the next timer (work -> break, break -> work).  
Press **reset** to end the session or change timer lengths.  

### Blocked Sites
Is there a website that you know will distract you? Just block it during work sessions! To block the site, you can either:  
a) Navigate to the site and press the big blue **add** button, or   
b) Type the URL hostname (for example, _github.com) and press **block**  
The site will be added to the blocked sites list!
If you visit the website again while the work timer is active, you'll see an overlay telling you how much time is left in the work session.  
To unblock the site either click on it in the list or navigate to it during a work session and press the blue **unblock site** button.  

### Overlay
During the work timer, every site on the block list will be blocked by an overlay, but you still have some options.  
**View the site once**, unblocking it until you navigate off of the tab. Upon revisiting the tab, the overlay will appear again.  
**Rremove the site from the block list**, removing the overlay permamently unless the site is added to the list again.  
**End the work session early**, starting the break timer and unblocking every page until the break is over.  
**End the timer**, turning off both the work and break timers and marking the end of the focus session (for now)
